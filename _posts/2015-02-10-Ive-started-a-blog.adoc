= I've started a blog

It's funny that I've not had a place to share long-form thoughts publicly for over a decade. I guess this is it: something simple and convenient enough to update from anywhere. No more waffling about choosing a blogging platform - it is finished.


I don't know what I'll be posting here, but it'll hopefully be interesting.
